# Agent Decisions Log

> **Append-only log of in-session corrections to AI agent behavior.**
> Operational, not architectural. For _why the system is built that way_ → ADRs in `docs/adr/`.
> For _how the agent should behave / what it missed / what to never repeat_ → here.
>
> **Read before non-trivial agent work** to avoid repeating past mistakes.
> **Append after any meaningful correction** that an agent received during a session.

## When to write here vs. an ADR

| Situation                                                                   | Goes to              |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| Architectural decision (BC, pattern, technology, cross-cutting)             | ADR                  |
| "Will I want to explain this to a new dev in a year?"                       | ADR                  |
| Agent missed a guard, forgot to read a context file, ignored an instruction | `agent-decisions.md` |
| Naming/format nit that the agent kept getting wrong                         | `agent-decisions.md` |
| Tool selection mistake (used wrong skill, wrong scope)                      | `agent-decisions.md` |
| Recurring drift you keep correcting in chat                                 | `agent-decisions.md` |

**Promotion rule**: if the same correction appears **2+ times** → promote to a permanent rule:

- Architectural rule → `anti-patterns-critical.context.md` or relevant `*.instructions.md`
- Workflow rule → relevant agent file (`bc-switch.md`, `code-reviewer.md`, etc.)
- Decision-level rule → new ADR via `@adr-generator`

When promoted, mark the entry **Status: Promoted → ADR-NNNN** (or file ref) and keep it for history.

## Entry format (Variant A — required)

```markdown
## YYYY-MM-DD — <agent-name> / <area>

- **Context**: What the agent tried to do.
- **Decision**: What the human decided instead (NO / YES / different approach).
- **Rationale**: Why — link to project-state line, ADR, instruction file, or commit.
- **Action**: What changes to instructions/agents/skills should follow (one concrete action).
- **Promote?**: When does this graduate to a permanent rule (e.g. "after 2nd occurrence → anti-patterns-critical").
- **Status**: Open | Resolved | Promoted → <ref>
```

Rules:

- One H2 per entry. **Append, do not edit history**.
- Date in `YYYY-MM-DD` format (today's real date).
- Keep entries scannable — 5–10 lines each. Link, don't quote.

## 2026-04-27 — Copilot / RAG MCP server config location

- **Context**: Agent created `.github/copilot/mcp.json` to register the RAG MCP server, then told the user the server was registered. VS Code's MCP browser showed no servers.
- **Decision**: The correct location is `.vscode/mcp.json`. `.github/copilot/mcp.json` is not read by VS Code's MCP server browser — it is only relevant for GitHub Codespaces / future GitHub Copilot tooling.
- **Rationale**: VS Code reads workspace MCP config from `.vscode/mcp.json`. The `.github/copilot/` path has no VS Code runtime effect.
- **Action**: Always create `.vscode/mcp.json` for VS Code MCP registration. Keep `.github/copilot/mcp.json` as a secondary copy for Codespaces compatibility only.
- **Promote?**: After 2nd occurrence → add to `docs-index.instructions.md` or a tooling note.
- **Status**: Resolved
- All entries in **English** for AI parsability.

## Example entry (template — replace with real ones)

## 2026-04-21 — bc-switch / Sales/Payments

- **Context**: Agent attempted to delete `Application/Services/Payments/PaymentHandler.cs` as part of the atomic switch.
- **Decision**: Do NOT delete during the switch.
- **Rationale**: `project-state.md` notes "Legacy `PaymentHandler` retained for Step 5 cleanup". The agent skipped reading project-state and assumed atomic switch implies delete-all-legacy.
- **Action**: Strengthen `bc-switch.md` Step 1 to require quoting the project-state line for the BC before any delete operation.
- **Promote?**: After 2nd occurrence → add explicit anti-pattern to `anti-patterns-critical.context.md` ("No legacy delete without project-state quote").
- **Status**: Open

## 2026-05-18 � Implementer / RAG .NET configuration discovery

- **Context**: While stabilising `tools/rag-dotnet` for local dev, the plan referenced a non-existent `tools/rag-dotnet/config.yaml` and a Python-venv `optimum-cli` step. Both wrong.
- **Decision**: (1) The .NET path **shares** `tools/rag/config.yaml` with Python � Dockerfile literally does `COPY ../rag/config.yaml /app/config.yaml`. No separate .NET config exists. (2) The HuggingFace ONNX bundle (`/onnx/model.onnx` + `vocab.txt` + `tokenizer.json` + `config.json`) is pre-exported by sentence-transformers maintainers, so a PowerShell/curl download replaces the Python optimum-cli stage entirely.
- **Rationale**: Source of truth verified in `tools/rag-dotnet/Dockerfile` line ~45 and HuggingFace repo for `paraphrase-multilingual-MiniLM-L12-v2`.
- **Action**: `RagConfig.ResolveConfigPath` uses 4-way priority: explicit arg � `RAG_CONFIG` � `RAG_WORKSPACE`-derived `<ws>/tools/rag/config.yaml` � `AppContext.BaseDirectory/config.yaml`. `RagConfig.Workspace` derives from config-path grandparent (Python parity with `config_path.parents[2]`), then `RAG_WORKSPACE`, then cwd. Local devs run `pwsh tools/rag-dotnet/download-model.ps1` once; Docker uses `curlimages/curl` stage. **Never invent `tools/rag-dotnet/config.yaml` again.**
- **Promote?**: Already permanent � encoded in `RagConfig.cs`, `download-model.ps1`, Dockerfile, `launchSettings.json`, and README. No further promotion needed.
- **Status**: Resolved
